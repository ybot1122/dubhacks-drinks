-- The Facebook Login Auth Flow --
1) User logs into Facebook
2) User grants permission to connect to our app. User ID and short-lived
	access token retrieved
3) Server verifies that the the access token is indeed associated to the
	provided User ID.
4) Session variable sets field 'logged' to true and also sets field 'uid' to
	the user's Facebook ID.

-- Session Variable --
Once the client is authenticated with Facebook and verified in our database,
their session variable gains certain fields.
	{
		logged: 	true/false,
		uid: 		"user ID",
		prev: 		"drink ID"
	}

-- Making Requests to our Server --
Making a GET request to /auth/ expects the following data: 	
	{
		fid:		"facebook ID",
		accToken: 	"facebook access token"
	}

Making a GET request to /update/ will return an error if the user's session
is invalid. Otherwise, it expects the following data:
	{
		name: 		"drink name",
		type: 		"drink type",
		volume: 	"drink volume"
	}

-- Requesting/Receiving Statistics --
Making a GET request to /user/ will return an error if session is invalid, otherwise it expects the following data:
	{
		name: 		"drink name",
		type: 		"drink type",
		volume: 	"drink volume",
	}

The standard response for a statistics request is:
	{
		calories: 	int representing calories per unit,
		sugar: 	int representing caffeine per unit,
		log: 		array of IsoTime objects for each unit
	}

-- Server Responses --
Every single GET request will receive one of the following responses:
On success:
	{
		status: 	"1",
		uid: 		"user ID"
	}

On failure:
	{
		status: 	"0",
		message: 	"error message"
	}
